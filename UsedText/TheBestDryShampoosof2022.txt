Dove Volume & Fullness Dry Shampoo


 Dove's dry shampoo leaves hair feeling almost suspiciously clean, closer to the freshness of a real shampoo than any other product we tested. The spray is fine and leaves behind little to no visible residue or chalky buildup in any hair type, from thin, light hair to thick, dark locks. The spray doesn't weigh hair down or stiffen it up, but on the flip side, it doesn't add too much volume, either. It has the recognizably fresh scent of Dove products that so many know and love. If you're looking for clean, fresh-feeling hair, Dove’s dry shampoo won't disappoint. 
Drybar Detox Dry Shampoo


 Detox DryBar dry shampoo is the quintessential dry shampoo: Though not a texturizing spray, it adds high-impact texture and volume and zaps grease and excess oil with just a little spritz. It's amazing and effective. It has the brand's classic, musky salon scent that can be perfumey, if not overpowering at times. It leaves behind some residue that can leave roots feeling a little chalky after use, but the trade-off is incredible volume. The spray comes in both light and dark tones to match your hair color. Keep in mind you can buy 6 bottles of Dove for the price of one Detox, so it may not be the best choice for the budget-conscious consumer, but it does work great on oily hair. 
Moroccanoil Dry Shampoo


 Moroccanoil dry shampoo is great for dry, dehydrated, or curly hair. It's infused with argan oil, so it moisturizes as it de-greases and it actually leaves hair feeling clean and silky instead of chalky and dull, while still adding some volume. It comes in both light and dark tones to match hair, and a little scalp massage totally eliminates any visible residue. Its light vanilla scent is not overwhelming and testers noted that it "smells absolutely delicious," and "the best of the bunch." While it doesn’t soak up as much oil as DryBar’s Detox, it’s a great option for those with dryer locks or scalp issues.
