Platinum Health HydroSlide


 Given the emphasis that Platinum Health puts on not just safety and functionality, but also on comfort, it’s no surprise the Platinum Health HydroSlide bath chair is our top pick. The shower bench is designed to fit virtually any tub, and extensions exist for tubs that are outside standard tub dimensions. What makes it so special is that the user sits down on the chair, lifts their legs, and presses a lever to swivel the chair to face into the tub.   Keep in mind that a certain amount of flexibility is required to lift one’s legs before swiveling the chair, and some finger dexterity and strength is needed to press down on the swivel lever. A caregiver or home attendant could help with these steps, if needed.
