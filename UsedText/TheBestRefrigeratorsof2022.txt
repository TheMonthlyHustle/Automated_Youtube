Bosch B36FD50SNS
 Dimensions: 70" x 35.63" x 32.13" (H x W x D)
   Dimensions: 70" x 35.63" x 32.13" (H x W x D)  Measured usable space: 12.71-cubic-foot refrigerator, 4.92-cubic-foot freezer  Style: French door  Dispensers: Through-the-door ice and water  Finish: Stainless steel  The Bosch B36FD50SNS is nearly perfect. Temperatures in both the fridge and freezer are exactly where they should be and don’t waver. Its fridge and freezer offer more storage than most other French doors. Its crispers hang on to humidity. It has a through-the-door water and ice dispenser. It also features a sleek, stainless steel finish.  In fact, the only point we can find to critique is that its spill-capture shelves only have lips in the front, not sides or back. While this fridge costs more than the average French-door fridge, between its excellent performance, features, and Bosch’s excellent warranty, we think it’s worth its purchase price.
