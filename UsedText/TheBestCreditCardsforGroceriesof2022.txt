Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express
Annual fee: $0 intro annual fee for the first year, then $95
 The Blue Cash Preferred from American Express makes our list as the best overall choice with a whopping 6% back at U.S. supermarkets. There's a $0 intro annual fee for the first year, then a $95 annual fee for each subsequent year. One the intro fee offer ends, the cash back you earn can easily cover the cost. You only need to spend about $1,600 per year ($133 per month or $30 per week) in the grocery category to break even. See rates and fees. Music lovers and binge-watchers may find this particularly worthwhile with 6% cash back on Apple Music, Netflix, HBO Max, and select U.S. streaming subscriptions. However, if you don’t think you’ll use the it enough to offset the cost with rewards earnings, consider the no-annual-fee Blue Cash Everyday instead. We’ll discuss that one next.   Annual fee: $0 intro annual fee for the first year, then $95 Grocery points: 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets, which does not include superstores and warehouse clubs. You’re eligible to earn rewards on the first $6,000 you spend each year—this works out to about $115 per week—and then an unlimited 1% thereafter.  Additional points: 6% on U.S. streaming subscriptions, 3% on transit spending, 3% at U.S. gas stations, and 1% on other eligible purchases. You can redeem rewards for a statement credit when your rewards balance reaches $25.  Perks: Spend $3,000 in purchases within the first six months and you’ll get a $250 statement credit. There's also an intro offer with zero interest on purchases and balance transfers for 12 months before a variable APR of 17.74% to 28.74% is introduced. There is a fee of either $5 or 5% (whichever is greater) for each balance transfer. Terms apply. See rates and fees.  Learn more about the Blue Cash Preferred 
Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express
Annual fee: None
 The Blue Cash Everyday is a no-fee grocery and gas card that packs a punch. You earn 3% cash back on the first $6,000 per year you spend at U.S. supermarkets, and 3% cash back at U.S. gas stations. Although this card and the Blue Cash Preferred have a $6,000 spending cap on groceries, Americans on average spend about $4,500 annually for “food at home,” according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, so shopping for your household may fit comfortably under this limit. See rates and fees.  Annual fee: None Grocery points: 3% cash back at U.S. supermarkets up to $6,000 per year—this works out to about $115 per week—and 1% thereafter. As with the Blue Cash Preferred, grocery hauls at superstores and warehouse clubs do not qualify for rewards.  Additional points: 3% Cash Back at U.S. gas stations up to $6,000 per year and 1% thereafter. You can redeem rewards for a statement credit when your balance reaches $25.  Perks: Spend $2,000 within the first six months and you’ll get $100 back as a statement credit. Additionally, cardholders can earn 20% back as a statement credit (up to $150) on purchases when using their new card to check out with PayPal in the first 6 months. Plus, there’s a 0% introductory APR on new purchases for the first 15 months. After that, a variable rate of 17.74% - 28.74% applies. Terms apply. See rates and fees.

Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card
Annual fee: None, although an Amazon Prime membership is required
 The Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature is another no-fee card that gives 5% back to eligible Amazon Prime members who shop at Amazon.com and Whole Foods Market. To be eligible for 5% back, you must keep the card connected to your Amazon account and maintain Prime membership by paying the annual or monthly membership fee.  While the card itself doesn’t have an annual fee, Prime membership costs $119 per year ($12.99 per month) and $59 per year ($6.49 per month) for students. But maintaining membership probably won’t be a dealbreaker for shoppers who’ve already joined to receive other Prime perks like two-day and same-day shipping.  If someone invited you to get shipping perks through their membership, you'll earn 3% back instead of the full 5% in the top category. You can, however, upgrade to the higher rewards rate if you join Amazon Households with an eligible Prime member.   Annual fee: None, although an Amazon Prime membership is required Grocery points: 5% back at Amazon.com (including Amazon Fresh orders, digital downloads, Amazon gift cards, and Amazon Prime subscriptions) and 5% back at Whole Foods Market locations and online.  Additional points: 2% at restaurants, gas stations, and drug stores, and 1% on all other eligible purchases.  Perks: There’s no minimum balance to redeem cash back. The card has no foreign transaction fee and comes with benefits like travel and emergency insurance.   Learn more about the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature 
Bank of America Cash Rewards
Annual fee: None
 The Bank of America Cash Rewards offers 2% cash back when you shop at grocery stores and wholesale clubs—unique in the world of grocery cards since club shopping is usually excluded from the supermarket category. This may be a smart choice for BJ’s and Sam’s Club shoppers, and especially people who frequent Costco since the warehouse exclusively accepts Visa. The rewards offer is 2% cash back on groceries and 3% cash back on a category of your choice. Pay close attention to the rewards cap: The combined spending limit for the 2% and 3% categories is $2,500 per quarter. The money you spend beyond the $2,500 cap earns just 1% back until the next quarter.  Bank of America customers with large account balances get an even better rewards deal. Preferred Rewards members qualify for 25% to 75% more in cash back. For the supermarket category, this equals up to a total of 3.5% cash back.   Annual fee: None Grocery points: 2% cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs. Additional points: 3% in the category of your choice (including gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drug stores, or home improvement) and 1% on all other purchases. The combined spending cap for the 3% and 2% categories is $2,500 every three months. Let’s say you choose gas for the 3% category. You’ll earn 3% and 2% back on the first $2,500 spent on gas and groceries purchased each quarter. Spend more than the limit and you’ll earn 1% cash back in those categories until the next quarter. Perks: Spend $1,000 in purchases during the first 90 days and you’ll earn a $200 cash bonus. The card also has an introductory 0% APR on new purchases for 15 months.

Capital One Walmart Rewards Card
Annual fee: None
 Loyal Walmart shoppers—especially those who order products and groceries online—may find a lot of value in this offer. You get 5% back when shopping at Walmart.com, and it includes grocery pickup and delivery.  You typically earn 2% back at Walmart locations and Walmart gas stations. However, for the first 12 months, the card gives 5% at the store checkout if you use Walmart Pay, a virtual wallet that stores your payment information for touch-free checkout.  Rewards are tracked in points and each point is worth one cent. Word of warning though: To get the most value from this card, you must be a dedicated Walmart shopper because the money you spend at other retailers that accept Mastercard will only earn 1% back.   Annual fee: None Grocery points: 5% back at Walmart.com, including grocery pickup and delivery. Additional points: 2% back at Walmart, Walmart gas stations, restaurants, and travel, and 1% cash back on everything else. You can redeem rewards for statement credit, gift cards, travel, or to make purchases at Walmart.com.  Perks:  For the first year, you earn 5% back at brick-and-mortar Walmart locations as long as you use Walmart Pay. Afterward, you earn 2% back in the store.

RedCard Mastercard
Annual fee:  None
 At Target, RedCard cardholders receive 5% off in-store and online purchases. The 5% discount is automatically applied when you swipe at checkout, but there are some restrictions. Prescriptions, over-the-counter pharmacy products, and eye exams at Target don’t qualify.  Cardholders get free shipping, exclusive store offers, and discount gift cards. You don’t earn rewards that can be redeemed for travel or merchandise from other retailers, so diehard Target fans will see the most value here. You could consider coupling this with a flat-rate or revolving category card to earn and redeem rewards for the spending you do outside of the big-box retailer.   Annual fee:  None Grocery points: You get 5% off at checkout each time you shop online or in the store. Additional points: 5% off on clearance items and in-store Starbucks locations. Perks: Free shipping and exclusive store offers, like an extra 30 days for eligible returns.  Learn more about the RedCard
