TheBestDishwashersThatDryYourDishesof2022
Bosch SHPM88Z75N


 When it comes to drying dishes, Bosch has the market cornered, thanks to its trademark CrystalDry technology, which uses zeolite crystals to completely dry all of your dishes, and does so efficiently.  This major selling point of the SHPM88Z75N—and the one you care about if you’re reading this guide—guarantees that even the plastic food storage containers, which always seem to need a couple of passes with a dish towel before you can put them away, will be entirely dry.  Overall, the SHPM88Z75N is everything we've come to expect from the Bosch dishwasher brand—quiet, efficient, and stylish. This dishwasher does an amazing job removing some difficult stains, like burnt-on cheese and spinach. However, as is the case with most dishwashers, the spinach that got blasted off of our test dishes was occasionally redeposited onto other dishes.
