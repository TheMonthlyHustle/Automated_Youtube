Happy Masks Pro Series


 If you’re looking for a comfortable, protective mask that kids won’t complain about wearing, the Happy Masks Pro Series are the way to go. These are some of the most breathable masks on the market and they claim to be some of the most protective. Designed by a retired chief scientist with a doctoral degree in filtration, these masks incorporate a nanofiber membrane filter that has been pharmaceutically tested. Happy Masks guarantees that these masks will block over 99.9% of airborne bacteria, pollution, and virus nanoparticles, making them the safest reusable mask we’ve found. Lightweight and breathable, they come with adjustable ear straps and a nose wire, and their innovative 3-D design allows for air circulation when breathing. According to Happy Masks, they will last for 50 washes, if cared for according to instructions, which makes them one of the most long-lasting reusable masks as well. You get a lot of bang for your buck with these masks. There are some downsides to Happy Masks, however. First is that they have to be washed by hand—putting them through a laundry cycle renders the built-in filter ineffective—which means that you'll need to order quite a few of these if you wash them after every use. They also begin to show stains after a while so you'll want to retire them.  All that taken into account, they’re still the favorite. If you want a long-lasting reusable mask with excellent protection, or if your child complains about a mask feeling constricting or being hard to breathe in, Happy Masks are the answer to all of your prayers.
