Samsung NX58H5600SS


 We loved this 5.8 cu ft. 5-burner gas range. It has nicely designed, stainless steel dials that create a super smooth turning experience, and the large digital display panel makes it easy to enter your precise oven temperature. The grates are well designed for easy cleaning, and you can remove the middle grate to place the custom griddle directly over the griddle burner. In addition to aesthetics, the Samsung NX58H5600SS is built to perform. It preheats exceptionally fast and did well on both the baking and roasting tasks. While the burners didnâ€™t heat our cast iron pan as evenly as some of the other ovens, it was quick to boil water. It comes in at a nice budget price for a convection oven, but it looks and performs much more like a high-end range.
