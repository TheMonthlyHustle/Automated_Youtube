Happiest Baby Sleepea 5-Second Baby Swaddle


 The Happiest Baby Sleepea boasts itself as the worldâ€™s first 5-second swaddle. With its double zipper that can open from top or bottom, inner arm wrap with extra-quiet Velcro, and breathable cotton and mesh to reduce overheating, this swaddle was the number one winner for both of our summer babies. This swaddle was a game changer, especially for babies who had several dirty diapers in the night during those first few weeks home. This swaddle allowed for easy diaper checks and changes and both babies settled into the swaddle almost by the time the zipper was up. One of the babies slept so soundly in this baby swaddle that mom was reluctant to switch it up to continue testing. And the other, a veritable swaddle Houdini, failed to bust out of this swaddle even during an extra-long night of sleep. Overall, we have very few negative things to say about the Sleepea. 
SwaddleMe Natural Position 2-in-1 Swaddle with Easy Change


 Like the winning swaddle, the SwaddleMe is secure and does a good job of preventing the startle reflex that will wake your baby. This wearable blanket is slightly more versatile than our top pick, in that you can swaddle your little one with their arms over their chest or by their sides.  Both babies started the night with their hands by their sides, but worked them up towards their chests as the night went on. But they both stayed asleep, which is what mattered. Our swaddle Houdini did manage to bust out of the SwaddleMe once she hit the 3-month mark, but this kept her securely compressed during the early days. The material is soft and durable, the designs are cute, and with a low price point, this swaddle is a really solid, budget-savvy purchase to have in your sleep arsenal.  Be warned that over time, the velcro may break down due to being washed.
