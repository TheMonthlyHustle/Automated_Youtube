Intuit TurboTax


 TurboTax is a standout among its competitors, especially when it comes to importing information to avoid manual entry. You can upload a PDF of previous year’s taxes to avoid re-entering your personal details. You can also take photos of forms, such as your W-2, to import each line, as well as directly connect to a number of financial institutions for some details, like IRA withdrawals. Saving time makes the process less of a hassle. Beyond that, TurboTax makes the process extremely simple and straightforward, whether it’s your first time submitting taxes on your own or you’re a seasoned pro.  Cost: TurboTax’s free version covers simple returns for federal and state taxes. It includes the 1040 form and allows for some credits, including the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. There’s a couple of changes filers may notice from 2020: The Free Edition now covers student loan interest, though it no longer supports unemployment income. One important note: This unpaid tier is different from the IRS Free File Program, which offersed free software to filers earnings $73,000 or less. TurboTax exited that program this year.  There are also multiple paid versions that allow you to access more credits, deductions, and income sources. These prices range from $59 to $119, plus $49 per state return. Customer support and guarantees: The TurboTax Free edition features a searchable FAQ sidebar, but you’ll need to upgrade to a paid version if you want live, personal support. No matter the tier, the program comes with a 100% accurate calculation guarantee: If you owe the IRS or your state penalty or interest because of a TurboTax calculation, it’ll pay you back for the fees and accrued interest. There’s some important details in the fine print, including following “the in-product TurboTax interview guidance” and notifying the company as soon as you learn of the error.   How did TurboTax adapt to our personas? Two out of four of our fictional personas fully maximized their taxes using TurboTax’s free edition. Devon Developer was able to deduct student loan interest from his income, which is a new feature to the Free edition this year. Additionally,  Ricky Retiree could quickly import his IRA distributions directly from his financial institution.  Vanessa and Shawn Dotington were prompted to upgrade to the Deluxe version to claim their child care expenses. Franny Freelancer needed to upgrade to the Self-employed version to maximize her business deductions, including advertising, legal services, and home office expenses.
