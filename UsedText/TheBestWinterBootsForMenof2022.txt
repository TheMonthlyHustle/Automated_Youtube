Kamik NationPlus Boot


 Constructed using water-resistant leather and a seam-sealed, synthetic rubber shell, the Kamik NationPlus is a good-looking boot. Kamik rates these boots to be able to keep your feet warm in temperatures as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit. I also like that their 11.5-inch tall shaft height makes you feel protected and secure without being too rigid.    While they’re not waterproof, the NationPlus Boots offer the best water resistance of any of the boots we found. The only negative for the NationPlus Boot is their heft: they weigh roughly 20% more than the next heaviest set of boots we found, the Sorel Caribou 1964 PAC. 
Sorel Men's 1964 Pac


 With their tall, 9.25-inch shaft, vulcanized rubber lower, and a fur cuff designed to keep snow from getting into the top of the boot, the Sorel Caribou 1964 PAC are a wintertime classic.  These boots keep a lot of heat during wear, ensuring that your toes will stay warm as you dare the winter chill on the way to work. And when treading on ice, we these boots provide adequate traction.   Sadly, they aren't waterproof: the 1964 PAC begin to leak just two minutes and 39 seconds into wearing them. So, they might offer adequate protection from stepping in an occasional shallow puddle, but the longer you wear these boots in snow or slush, the greater the possibility that your feet will get wet. That said, should your feet get soaked, Sorel makes it easy to get dry and moving again, quickly: The thick felt liners of the 1964 PAC can be removed and swapped out for a dry set. Additional sets of boot liners can be purchased online.  You should know that, like our Best Overall pick, the 1964 PAC’s bulk keeps them from being the nimblest of boots. They’re fine for tasks like walking and shoveling. However, wearing them while driving a car or climbing a ton of stairs can be a heavy drag.
