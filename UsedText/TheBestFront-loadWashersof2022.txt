Electrolux ELFW7637AT


 The Electrolux ELFW7637AT checks all the right boxes. First and foremost, it’s a great washing machine. During testing, we found that it can deal with various stains, from protein to oil. The internal water heater also adds a lot of versatility, allowing you to sanitize clothing of common diseases, like E. coli, get rid of allergens, and help keep your whites as bright as can be. Secondly, the ELFW7637AT comes equipped with plenty of features that just make life better. For example, instead of tossing Tide pods in the drum where soap won’t get evenly distributed, this washer has a special spot for them in the detergent drawer. There are also options like Extended Refresh that will tumble laundry after a cycle is finished to keep it from getting musty.  Finally, this Electrolux just has a great fit and finish. You can tell that the manufacturing is well done by the clean text on the control panel and the satisfying click on the dial. After all our testing, we also think the Electrolux ELFW7637AT is perfect for most families. It has the drum capacity, cleaning performance, and features to cover all the major laundry bases. That’s why it takes the top spot in our washing machine rankings.
